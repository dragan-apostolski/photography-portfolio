# Eko Kamp Rinčica

A commercial photography project capturing the stunning landscapes and sustainable facilities of Eko Kamp Rinčica. This series showcases the harmony between natural beauty and eco-friendly tourism, highlighting the camp's unique position within pristine Slovenian wilderness.

## Creative Vision

The project aims to convey the essence of sustainable travel and connection with nature. Each photograph captures the camp's integration with its natural surroundings while emphasizing the comfort and accessibility of the eco-friendly accommodations and facilities.

## Technical Approach

Shot primarily during golden hours to maximize natural lighting and landscape beauty, the series focuses on:

- **Environmental context** showing the camp's position within the wider landscape
- **Natural details** highlighting flora, water features, and terrain characteristics
- **Architectural integration** demonstrating how structures complement rather than impose on the environment
- **Lifestyle elements** depicting the experience of staying at an eco-camp

This commercial photography collection serves both as documentation of Eko Kamp Rinčica's offerings and as a promotional tool that emphasizes their commitment to environmental stewardship and sustainable tourism practices.
