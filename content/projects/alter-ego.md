# Alter Ego

An introspective creative portrait series that delves into the fascinating concept of alter ego - the hidden or alternative self that exists within each of us. Through artistic photography techniques and creative composition, this project explores themes of dual identity, self-reflection, and the different facets of personality that we present to the world versus our inner selves.

## Creative Vision

The series employs dramatic lighting, creative angles, and thoughtful composition to create compelling portraits that suggest depth and complexity. Each image captures a different aspect of identity - from confident and bold to introspective and vulnerable, showcasing the multifaceted nature of human personality.

## Technical Approach

Shot using available light and creative positioning, the series emphasizes:

- **Dramatic lighting** to create mood and atmosphere
- **Dynamic compositions** that engage the viewer
- **Authentic expressions** that convey genuine emotion
- **Artistic post-processing** to enhance the conceptual narrative

This project represents a collaboration between photographer and subject to explore the deeper aspects of identity and self-expression through the medium of portrait photography.
